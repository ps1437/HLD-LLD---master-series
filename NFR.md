# Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) 

## 1. **Performance**

### 1.1. Response Time
- The system should generate a shortened URL within **100 milliseconds** of receiving a request.
- The redirection from a shortened URL to the original URL should be completed in **less than 500 milliseconds** under normal load conditions.

### 1.2. Throughput
- The system should be capable of handling at least **10,000 requests per second** (RPS) for both URL shortening and redirection services.

### 1.3. Availability
- The system should be available **99.99% of the time**. This translates to **less than 4 hours of downtime per year**.
- Downtime should be scheduled and communicated to users with at least 24 hours of notice.

## 2. **Scalability**

### 2.1. Horizontal Scalability
- The system should support horizontal scaling to handle growing traffic and increase the throughput of URL shortening and redirection.
- As user load increases, new application instances should be added dynamically without impacting existing users.

### 2.2. Database Scalability
- The system should use a database that can scale horizontally to accommodate growing amounts of URL data.
- The system should support sharding or partitioning of the database to ensure it can handle a large volume of shortened URLs efficiently.

### 2.3. Caching
- Frequently accessed URLs should be cached using an in-memory cache (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to reduce database load and improve response time for redirections.

## 3. **Reliability**

### 3.1. Fault Tolerance
- The system should be fault-tolerant, meaning that if one part of the system (e.g., URL shortening or redirection service) fails, the entire service should not be impacted.
- Redundancy mechanisms should be in place for critical components like databases, caches, and application servers.

### 3.2. Data Consistency
- The system should ensure eventual consistency of the data when using distributed databases.
- Write failures should not prevent the generation of shortened URLs, but should be retried or logged for manual intervention.

## 4. **Security**

### 4.1. Data Protection
- All user data, including shortened URLs and original URLs, should be stored securely.
- Sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest (using encryption algorithms).

### 4.2. Authentication & Authorization
- The system should provide optional user authentication, enabling users to track their shortened URLs.
- Role-based access controls (RBAC) should be implemented to allow users with the appropriate permissions to delete or update shortened URLs.

### 4.3. URL Validation
- The system should validate input URLs to prevent the creation of malformed or malicious links. This includes checking for invalid URL formats or suspicious links pointing to harmful sites.

### 4.4. Anti-Spam & Abuse Prevention
- The system should have mechanisms in place to detect and prevent abuse (e.g., spamming, phishing URLs).
- Shortened URLs should be monitored and flagged for suspicious activities, such as unusually high usage or patterns indicating automated abuse.

## 5. **Usability**

### 5.1. User Interface
- The system should provide a simple and intuitive web interface or API for users to shorten URLs and retrieve analytics on usage.
- Users should be able to easily input URLs, shorten them, and share them via email or social media.
  
### 5.2. API Availability
- The system should expose a well-documented and easy-to-use RESTful API for external developers to integrate URL shortening into their applications.

### 5.3. Customization
- The system should allow users to customize their shortened URLs (e.g., specifying a custom alias instead of a random string) for better branding and memorability.

## 6. **Maintainability**

### 6.1. Logging and Monitoring
- The system should include detailed logging for all critical events, such as URL shortening requests, redirection requests, errors, and system failures.
- Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) should be used to track system health, performance, and other key metrics, enabling proactive maintenance.

### 6.2. Error Handling
- The system should handle errors gracefully, providing informative error messages for users and logging errors for system administrators.
- Automatic error recovery and retries should be in place to handle transient issues without user intervention.

### 6.3. Documentation
- The system should be well-documented, including technical documentation, API documentation, and user guides.
- The codebase should be clean, well-commented, and follow consistent naming conventions to facilitate future updates and maintenance.

## 7. **Compliance**

### 7.1. GDPR Compliance
- The system should comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Union, ensuring data privacy and allowing users to request the deletion of their data.

### 7.2. Accessibility
- The system should be accessible according to WCAG 2.1 standards to ensure users with disabilities can use the URL shortening services.

### 7.3. Legal Compliance
- The system should ensure that the shortened URLs comply with the legal standards of the region in which it operates, including restrictions on harmful or illegal content.

## 8. **Disaster Recovery**

### 8.1. Backup Strategy
- The system should have a regular backup strategy in place to ensure that all data, including the mapping between shortened URLs and original URLs, is backed up regularly.
- Backups should be stored in a geographically separate location to provide protection against data loss in the event of a disaster.

### 8.2. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- The system should have defined RTO and RPO metrics to ensure that the system can recover from failures within a reasonable timeframe, and data loss is minimized.

## 9. **Cost**

### 9.1. Cost Optimization
- The system should be designed to optimize resource usage to minimize operational costs, especially in terms of cloud services, storage, and bandwidth usage.
- The system should allow for scaling up or down based on demand to optimize costs during periods of low or high usage.
