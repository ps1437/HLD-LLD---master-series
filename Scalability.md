# High-Level Design (HLD) for Scalability

## Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture for ensuring **scalability** in our system. It outlines the strategies and components used to scale the application to meet increasing loads and maintain performance.

## 1. Scalability Requirements

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Ability to scale out by adding more instances to distribute load.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Ability to scale up by adding more resources (CPU, memory) to existing instances.
- **Elasticity**: Dynamic scaling of resources based on demand.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution of traffic among multiple instances to ensure even load distribution.

## 2. Architecture Components

### 2.1. Load Balancer

- **Purpose**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
- **Technology**: NGINX, HAProxy, or AWS ELB
- **Scaling Strategy**: Auto-scaling policies are applied to add or remove instances based on traffic.

### 2.2. Web Servers

- **Purpose**: Handle client requests and serve responses.
- **Technology**: Nginx, Apache, or Spring Boot (with clustered instances)
- **Scaling Strategy**: Web servers are horizontally scalable with load balancing and auto-scaling.

### 2.3. Application Servers

- **Purpose**: Manage business logic and handle service requests.
- **Technology**: Spring Boot, Node.js, etc.
- **Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling via containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes) for dynamic scaling.

### 2.4. Database Layer

- **Purpose**: Store and retrieve persistent data.
- **Technology**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra
- **Scaling Strategy**:
  - **Read Scaling**: Using read replicas and read/write splitting.
  - **Write Scaling**: Sharding to split large datasets across multiple databases.
  - **Database Clustering**: Horizontal scaling with clustering techniques (e.g., Galera for MySQL).
  - **Caching**: Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data.

### 2.5. Caching Layer

- **Purpose**: Reduce database load by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
- **Technology**: Redis, Memcached
- **Scaling Strategy**: Cache shards across multiple servers for horizontal scaling.

### 2.6. Message Queues

- **Purpose**: Decouple components and enable asynchronous communication.
- **Technology**: RabbitMQ, Kafka
- **Scaling Strategy**: Distribute message queues across multiple brokers, enabling horizontal scaling.

### 2.7. Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- **Purpose**: Offload static content delivery (images, videos, stylesheets).
- **Technology**: AWS CloudFront, Akamai, Cloudflare
- **Scaling Strategy**: Distribute static content across geographically distributed edge locations for better performance and scalability.

## 3. Auto-Scaling Strategy

- **Horizontal Auto-Scaling**: Servers automatically scale in or out based on real-time traffic load and defined thresholds.
- **Vertical Auto-Scaling**: Instances scale up/down based on resource utilization (CPU, memory).
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, GCP, Azure (depending on infrastructure)
- **Auto-Scaling Triggers**: CPU usage > 80%, Memory usage > 75%, Request count > 1000 per minute.

## 4. Data Storage Scalability

### 4.1. Data Sharding

- **Purpose**: Split large datasets across multiple databases to distribute the load.
- **Strategy**: Implementing sharding by key (e.g., user ID, geographic region).

### 4.2. Data Replication

- **Purpose**: Ensure high availability and fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple instances.
- **Strategy**: Use master-slave or master-master replication models depending on consistency and availability requirements.

## 5. Monitoring and Performance Tuning

- **Purpose**: Ensure optimal performance through continuous monitoring.
- **Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, AWS CloudWatch
- **Metrics Tracked**: Response time, request throughput, database query performance, cache hit ratio, server load.
- **Scaling Triggers**: Based on performance thresholds (e.g., high latency or error rates).

## 6. Fault Tolerance

- **Redundancy**: Multiple instances of each component to prevent single points of failure.
- **Data Backup**: Regular backups of databases and important files.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Use multi-region deployments for disaster recovery in case of regional failures.

## 7. Conclusion

The scalability design focuses on enabling the system to handle varying loads by implementing horizontal and vertical scaling, caching, load balancing, and efficient data storage solutions. The architecture is built to be elastic, automatically adjusting resources based on demand, ensuring high availability and performance.
